Current Gaps in Build

Area Gap / Risk     Recommendation

Technical Stack Details  Missing specifics on technology choices (e.g., hosting, database engines, CI/CD).    Define Azure services (e.g., Dataverse, Functions, Web Apps), security model, and deployment pipeline.

Security & Compliance    RLS/OLS mentioned briefly, but no detail on authentication, data privacy (especially for minors).   Add an “Authentication & Security” section: Azure AD roles, GDPR/FERPA compliance, encryption.

Simulated Market Logic   Market event simulation logic is high level; unclear how price feeds or randomization work.    Specify algorithms or services (e.g., Azure ML model for price simulation, event scheduling logic).

UX & Accessibility  User experience flows are noted but no wireframes, accessibility standards, or performance SLAs.    Include clickable prototypes or wireframes; reference WCAG 2.1 guidelines and performance targets.

Instructor Tools    Tools instructors need for creating/scheduling events and uploading content aren’t fully detailed.  Define a “Webinar Management” component: content staging, versioning, and analytics dashboard.

Reporting & Analytics    “Report” tables exist, but specifics on dashboards, KPIs, and export formats are absent.  Outline a Power BI workspace: key dashboards (engagement, learning outcomes), refresh schedules.
