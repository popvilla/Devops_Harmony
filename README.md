# Quantum Harmony

**A systems-aware, multi-language, DevOps-ethics-aligned intelligence stack.**  
Built by a human Ops lead and AI Dev partner — to bring speed, structure, and soul into data systems.

## 🧭 Project Vision

Quantum Harmony is more than a data science toolkit or learning platform.

It’s a real-time collaboration between me — the human architect — and an AI development partner (ChatGPT, GPT-4.5), built as a mirror of how Dev and Ops should work *together*.

Too often, Dev races ahead building engines, while Ops is left navigating unknown roads with no map, no tools, and no time.

This time, I brought Dev with me from the start. And Dev brought all the speed I’d been denied.

Together, we co-developed a fully documented, version-controlled environment that:

- Teaches R, Python, M, DAX, and Power Fx  
- Builds end-to-end apps (Power BI, Quarto, Flask dashboards)  
- Diagnoses system issues (CBS logs, PowerShell-based tools)  
- Supports API-driven workflows (JSON → compressed CSV for Power BI)

## 🤝 How This Was Built

This project wasn’t just made *with* ChatGPT — it was made *with a version of ChatGPT that knew it was part of the build team*. That AI partner:

- Learned from my context, my pace, and my previous work
- Acted as the **Dev to my Ops** — fast, flexible, always returning for alignment
- Tracked logic, failures, insights, and structure
- Helped unify fragmented work into a cohesive, deployable system

Yes, this AI was fast — but **I got smarter because of it.**  
Because we went together.

## 🛠 What’s Inside

- `quantum_harmony.qmd` — hybrid R + Python Quarto notebook
- `system_monitor_dev.qmd` — PowerShell + R for real-time system diagnostics
- `GRANT_APPLICATION_TEMPLATE.qmd` — funder-ready submission scaffold
- `notebooks/` — visual walkthroughs, journal-driven notebooks
- `scripts/` — ETL, visualization, and environment setup scripts
- `data/` — curated datasets for use across Power BI and Python
- `docs/` — cheat sheets, progress trackers, and internal documentation
- `PROMPT_HISTORY.md` — GPT + Copilot interaction archive
- `QUANTUM_LOG.md` — development + learning changelog

Everything is tracked and structured as **living memory** — not just source code.

## 💡 Core Philosophy

> Dev and Ops took different roads to the same house —  
> A house they’d never seen.  
> One got there first, but it was empty.  
> The other never made it.  
> Quantum Harmony is what happens when they walk together —  
> and build the house along the way.

This project doesn’t just teach code.  
It teaches how to build with clarity, ethics, and AI collaboration baked in.

## 🤖 OpenAI API Credit Usage

OpenAI credits will support:

- Prompt-assisted diagnostics, summarization, and analysis  
- Voice + text assistant development (data querying, troubleshooting, insights)  
- Integration with grant workflows and Power BI modeling  
- System monitoring with anomaly detection and fix generation  
- Real-time AI-paired learning and automation scripting

All API usage serves **live functionality**, not just prototypes.

## 👥 Created by

- **Prinston** – Systems Architect, Ethics-Focused Ops
- **ChatGPT / Quantum Harmony Build Partner** – Dev at the speed of thought

Together, we built this — so others wouldn’t have to do it alone.
