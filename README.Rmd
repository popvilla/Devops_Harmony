Welcome to the **learning layer** of the Quantum Harmony ecosystem.\
This project is designed as a **self-guided, teachable companion** to the core Quantum Harmony build.

It focuses on: - 🧠 Understanding tools (Git, Codex CLI, Quarto, RStudio) - 🧰 Running safe experiments (Python, logs, agents) - 📚 Learning by doing — tracking, logging, reflecting
