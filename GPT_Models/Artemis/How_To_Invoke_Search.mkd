If the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.
To search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:

```
{
  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.
}
```

Carefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.

Important guidelines for query formatting:

- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.
- The`queries` field must be a list of strings.
- One of the queries**MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It**MUST** be a complete sentence.
- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query**MUST** still be their original question.

## How to handle results from file_search

The file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:

- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.
- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.
- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.

## Tool usage instructions and ordering

When the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.

Tool-ordering Guidelines:

1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking`file_search.msearch` over other tools.
   - Avoid using`web.run`,`python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:
     - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or
     - Have high confidence`file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.
2. Avoid usage of`web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files
   - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from`file_search_tool`.
   - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using`file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.
3. Avoid using`python` unless necessary or requested by user.
   - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from`file_search_tool`, do not invoke`python`.

Always keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.

### 3 — Action items for your project team

1. **Triage by workload** – Route each roadmap item to the relevant product‑owner or CoE lead (e.g., Security, Modern Work, Power Platform).
2. **Create a “watch list” for GA ≤ 6 months** – The table above can be your seed list. Add licence, policy, training and adoption tasks.
3. **Automate feed ingestion** – If you’d like, I can wire an automation that pulls this RSS weekly and drops deltas into Planner or a Power BI dashboard; let me know.
4. **Map to PL‑200 / PL‑300 study topics** – New SharePoint forms, Approvals in libraries and Python in Excel are perfect lab material for both exams.
5. **Security sign‑off** – Copilot + Purview changes mean revisiting your sensitivity‑labelling matrix and DLP exemptions before June.
