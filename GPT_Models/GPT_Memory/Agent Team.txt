I will generate a compact, sharable payload that includes:
- 🧭 Your **vision** and build philosophy (Jarvis, FinLit, Data Architect)
- 🧱 The **tech stack**: Power Platform, Python, JSON-to-ZIP, Power BI, semantic DAX
- 🧩 The **module roles**:
   - 🧠 *Planner GPT* (architectural framing, philosophical grounding)
   - ⚙️ *Builder GPT* (PowerApps, Python scripts, workflows)
   - 🧪 *Researcher GPT* (component feasibility, system theory, DevOps practice)
- 🧬 A **looping protocol**: What feeds back into what, what you want returned, where outputs go
